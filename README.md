### `This App is the MVP for an event planning tool`

While this project was inspired by the Flatiron school curriculum It is not the end goal. Having worked with a many local youth ministries I noticed that most plan their events on paper if at all. This makes it difficult to smoothly transition leadership, let alone the consistency of the meetings from week to week.

As an MVP a user is able to schedule out events and later return to provide a detailed schedule of the event.

see the app home page for planned features.
